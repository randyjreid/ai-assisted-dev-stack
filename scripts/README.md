# Setup and Automation Scripts

This directory will contain setup, verification, and automation scripts in future phases of the AI Assisted Dev Stack project.

## Planned Scripts (Phase 2)

- **bootstrap_wsl.sh** – Automated WSL and Ubuntu base setup
- **install_core_tools.sh** – Installation of Git, GitHub CLI, and core utilities
- **install_ai_tools.sh** – Automated installation of Claude Code CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI, and related AI tooling
- **verify_stack.sh** – Stack verification and health check script

These scripts will enable quick, reproducible environment setup on new machines once the core stack is stable and fully documented.
