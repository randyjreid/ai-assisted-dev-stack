# Implementation and Testing Workflow

[← Back to Workflows Overview](../workflows.md)

This playbook tracks how a planned change is built in a branch, validated locally, and prepared for review with AI assistance throughout the process.

## Goals
Capture the definition of done for implementation, covering code completeness, automated checks, and alignment with requirements before review.

## Inputs and Outputs
Identify the branch plan, design notes, and requirements that feed implementation along with the code changes, test results, and status updates produced.

## Step by Step Flow
Describe the day to day development sequence, including environment setup, incremental commits, local testing, and readiness checks.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Explain how Copilot accelerates coding, Claude Code handles larger edits or refactors, and Codex provides mid-flight validation or alternate perspectives.
