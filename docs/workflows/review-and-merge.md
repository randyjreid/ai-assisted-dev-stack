[← Back to Workflows Overview](../workflows.md)

This playbook outlines how changes are reviewed by humans and AI partners, refined through feedback, and merged into the main branch.

## Goals
Define what a thorough review covers, how feedback is incorporated, and the criteria for merging with confidence.

## Inputs and Outputs
List the pull request inputs, context documents, and status checks required, as well as the review notes, approvals, and merge records produced.

## Step by Step Flow
Map the full review path from PR creation through iterative updates, final approvals, and merge execution.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Describe how Claude Code performs structured reviews, Codex offers an independent assessment, and Copilot assists with quick fixes identified during review.
