# Design and Architecture Workflow

[← Back to Workflows Overview](../workflows.md)

This playbook explains when and how to create or update design artifacts as ideas evolve into structured technical plans.

## Goals
Capture the purpose of design work, including evaluating tradeoffs, documenting architectural decisions, and establishing clear technical direction before implementation begins.

## Inputs and Outputs
Identify what feeds into design work such as requirements, constraints, and existing system documentation along with the design artifacts produced such as diagrams, decision records, and technical specifications.

## Step by Step Flow
Describe the ordered activities from recognizing the need for design through validating design decisions and confirming readiness for implementation.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Explain how Claude Code and Codex support design exploration, tradeoff analysis, diagram generation, and technical documentation while maintaining human ownership of architectural decisions.
