# Merge and Validation Workflow

This playbook captures the checks performed before merging, the execution of the merge itself, and the validation that happens immediately afterward.

## Goals
State the objectives of a safe merge, including protecting main, preventing regressions, and confirming successful deployment or integration steps.

## Inputs and Outputs
Describe the artifacts reviewed before merge (test logs, approvals, release notes) and the resulting checkpoints such as merge commits, tags, or validation reports.

## Step by Step Flow
Detail the sequence from final review sign-off through merge execution, post-merge verification, and communication of the outcome.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Outline how Claude Code helps verify readiness, Codex double-checks diff integrity, and Copilot assists with quick fixes found during validation.
