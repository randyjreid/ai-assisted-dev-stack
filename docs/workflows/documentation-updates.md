# Documentation Updates Workflow

[← Back to Workflows Overview](../workflows.md)

This playbook defines how documentation evolves with each change so that guides, references, and playbooks accurately reflect the current stack.

## Goals
Clarify the expectations for documentation completeness, tone, and alignment with project conventions.

## Inputs and Outputs
Identify the triggers for doc updates, source material such as change logs or design notes, and the updated files, changelog entries, or release notes created.

## Step by Step Flow
Lay out the checkpoints for reviewing existing docs, writing updates, validating accuracy, and coordinating with other workflows.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Explain how Claude Code drafts structured updates, Codex reviews for clarity or coverage, and Copilot assists with smaller edits or formatting.
