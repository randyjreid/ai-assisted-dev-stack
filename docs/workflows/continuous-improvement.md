## Goals
Explain the intent to keep the stack adaptive by identifying opportunities, closing gaps, and ensuring the workflows stay relevant.

## Inputs and Outputs
List the feedback sources such as retrospectives, tool diagnostics, or user input along with the backlog items, experiments, or documentation updates produced.

## Step by Step Flow
Show the cadence for collecting insights, triaging improvements, testing changes, and rolling them into the stack roadmap.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Discuss how Claude Code and Codex assist in analyzing retrospectives, proposing refinements, and drafting updated templates while Copilot helps apply smaller adjustments.
