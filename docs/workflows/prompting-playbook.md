# Prompting Playbook

[← Back to Workflows Overview](../workflows.md)

This playbook captures how prompts, shared context, and interaction patterns keep the AI tools aligned with project goals throughout a task.

## Goals
Document the objectives of effective prompting, including clarity, shared context, and reuse of prompt templates for common workflows.

## Inputs and Outputs
Outline what information is gathered before prompting, which artifacts are produced, and how conversation transcripts are stored for future reference.

## Step by Step Flow
Provide the sequence for preparing a prompt, validating AI responses, and iterating when clarification or corrections are required.

## How AI Tools Are Used
Describe how Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot each consume prompts, including when to switch tools or combine their strengths during an interaction.
